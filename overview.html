<h1 class="PwMt2d"><strong>Simulation of the COVID-19 pandemic and its epidemiological and economical impacts</strong></h1>
<p id="h.p_nkaiC47wDwjI" class="zfr3Q" style="direction: ltr; text-align: justify; white-space: normal;">To help research against the COVID-19 crisis, the use of reinforcement learning in a pandemic simulation could prove useful. An agent trained in such an environment could inform us about the best course of actions to take in this scenario.<br>
        		
In our simulation, we focus on both the epidemiological and economical aspects of the pandemic: the agent represents the government which has to limit the spread of the virus and its toll on the population's health, but also keep the economy running.</p>
